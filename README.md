<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of deconfectHelpers is to gather functions that might be helpful for my deconvolution project. It's mainly wrappers to quickly process deconvolution results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of deconfectHelpers from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonathanspeh/deconfectHelpers")
```

## Functions
Most functions are just conviniance functions for very specific purposes, and have very little use outside of my project.
`run_cellanneal_r()` provides a wrapper around the [cellanneal](https://github.com/LiBuchauer/cellanneal) python package.
